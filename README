MoneyWorks.pm, version 0.02 (beta)

Perl interface to MoneyWorks accounting software


CHANGES IN THIS RELEASE

• Port numbers  are  no  longer  inserted  automatically  into  money-
  works://  URLs.  (I didn’t realise at first  that  there  are  *two*
  default ports, depending on the type of server.)
• For the sake of security,  file  names  are  no  longer  passed  to
  moneyworks on the command line, but through STDIN.
• Password-protected local files can now be opened  (this feature was
  documented in the first release, but was never added).


INSTALLATION

The easiest way to install this module is to use the CPAN  module  or
the cpan script:

    [sudo] perl -MCPAN -e "install MoneyWorks"

    [sudo] cpan MoneyWorks

Or you can use the following:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    [sudo] make install


DEPENDENCIES

This module requires MoneyWorks  Gold  (or  Datacentre  Client)  (see
http://cognito.co.nz),  perl 5.6 or higher and the  constant::lexical
module, which can be found on the CPAN.


DOCUMENTATION

After installing,  you can find documentation for  this  module  with
the perldoc command.

    perldoc MoneyWorks

Or try using man (it's faster, in my experience):

    man MoneyWorks
