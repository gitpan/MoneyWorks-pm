MoneyWorks.pm, version 0.03 (beta)

Perl interface to MoneyWorks accounting software


CHANGES IN THIS RELEASE

• Error messages are now more verbose.  MoneyWorks.pm  used to choose
  between Diagnostic and Error  headers,  but it’s not always easy to
  tell which would be the most helpful to the user,  so both are used.
• Documentation fix: passwd -> password
• The  eval  method now replaces line breaks with spaces  instead  of
  dying  (since  MoneyWorks  expressions cannot contain line  breaks).
  This makes it easier to write long expressions.
• The tie interface can now  deal  with  @  signs  (which  MoneyWorks
  usually treats  specially),  so  you  can  write  things  like  $mw
 ->tie("name","email")->{'clext@gled.blit'}.
• The  export  method no longer requires the key to be in the list of
  exported fields.
• The  command  method now strips nulls,  but  warns  when  doing  so.
• mw_cli_quote now warns if it sees line breaks.
• The  export  method no longer requires a list of  fields.  It  will
  export all fields by default.

The easiest way to install this module is to use the CPAN  module  or
the cpan script:

    [sudo] cpan MoneyWorks

Or you can use the following:

    perl Makefile.PL

http://cognito.co.nz),  perl 5.6 or higher and the  constant::lexical

After installing,  you can find documentation for  this  module  with
the perldoc command.

Or try using man (it's faster, in my experience):
