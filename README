MoneyWorks.pm, version 0.06 (beta)

Perl interface to MoneyWorks accounting software


CHANGES IN THIS RELEASE

We now intercept  SIGPIPEs to stop the perl process from being killed
if the MW process crashes.


INSTALLATION

The easiest way to install this module is to use the CPAN  module  or
the cpan script:

    [sudo] perl -MCPAN -e "install MoneyWorks"

    [sudo] cpan MoneyWorks

Or you can use the following:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    [sudo] make install


DEPENDENCIES

This module requires
 • MoneyWorks Gold (or Datacentre Client)  (see http://cognito.co.nz),
 • perl 5.6 or higher and
 • the constant::lexical module, which can be found on the CPAN.

If you are using perl 5.12 or higher, you will need the Classic::Perl
module, too.


DOCUMENTATION

After installing,  you can find documentation for  this  module  with
the perldoc command.

    perldoc MoneyWorks

Or try using man (it's faster, in my experience):

    man MoneyWorks
