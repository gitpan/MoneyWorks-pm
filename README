INSTALLATION

The easiest way to install this module is to use the CPAN  module  or
the cpan script:

    [sudo] perl -MCPAN -e "install MoneyWorks"

    [sudo] cpan MoneyWorks

Or you can use the following:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    [sudo] make install


DEPENDENCIES

This module requires
 • MoneyWorks Gold (or Datacentre Client)  (see http://cognito.co.nz),
 • perl 5.6 or higher and
 • the constant::lexical module, which can be found on the CPAN.

If you are using perl 5.12 or higher, you will need the Classic::Perl
module, too.


DOCUMENTATION

After installing,  you can find documentation for  this  module  with
the perldoc command.

    perldoc MoneyWorks

Or try using man (it's faster, in my experience):

    man MoneyWorks
