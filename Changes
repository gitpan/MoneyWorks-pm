Revision history for MoneyWorks.pm

0.02  16 May, 2009
    • Port numbers are no longer inserted  automatically  into  money-
      works://  URLs.  (I didn’t realise at first that there are *two*
      default ports, depending on the type of server.)
    • For the sake of security,  file names are no longer  passed  to
      moneyworks on the command line, but through STDIN.
    • Password-protected local files can now be opened  (this feature
      was documented in the  first  release,  but  was  never  added).
